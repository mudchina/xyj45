
Okay, here is a legal way.  Unlike FY, you can gain exp. through fighting
in this mud, and is the best way to gain exp.  But, there are a few tricks
as to how you should fight.  First of all, NEVER EVER enable special dodge 
if you can help it.  Secondly, don't enable special weapon if you can help
it. Thirdly, it might be a good idea to fight with "jitui." Yeah, I know it
sounds silly, but it really makes your daoxing fly.  If you are fighting
with your special weapon(i.e. stick for daoshi), disable the special weapon
(i.e. qianjun-bang), but enable the weapon skill for parry(i.e. enable parry
qianjun-bang).  Lastly, try to fight multiple opponents if you can, because
that multiplies your exp.  For example, you can fight two jia ding at gao,
two wushi under sea, two yecha under sea.  In changan, west of c.s., there
is a place where you can fight SIX yayi at the same time!!!!!!  I missed that
part, since changan didn't open until late.  So, don't have any personal
exp. with it, but I figure if 2 yecha can help me gain 7 years of daoxing
in a day. 6 Yayi must be able to do WONDERS with your daoxing.

But, beware, some of these people has weapons, so you must break their
weapons using a hammer.  If you fought with jitui, you would already have 
some hammer skills.(since jitui is considered hammer).  Once you broke their 
weapons, use jitui to fight with them.

That's it.  Good luck!!!
